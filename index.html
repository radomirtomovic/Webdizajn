            <h3>What is Jazz?</h3>
            <p>
                Jazz is a kind of music in which improvisation is typically an important part.
                In most jazz performances, players play solos which they make up on the spot,
                which requires considerable skill. There is tremendous variety in jazz, but
                most jazz is very rhythmic, has a forward momentum called "swing," and
                uses "bent" or "blue" notes. You can often hear "call--and--response" patterns
                in jazz, in which one instrument, voice, or part of the band answers another.
                (You can hear Ella Fitzgerald and Roy Eldridge do "call and response" in Ella's Singing Class.)
                Jazz can express many different emotions, from pain to sheer joy.
                In jazz, you may hear the sounds of freedom-for the music has been a powerful voice
                for people suffering unfair treatment because of the color of the skin,
                or because they lived in a country run by a cruel dictator.

                <p>
                    Marcus Miller, winner of the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album of
                    2001, was born in Brooklyn in 1959 and raised in Jamaica, New York.
                    He came from a musical family and was influenced early on by his father,
                    a church organist and choir director, as well as his musical extended family
                    (which included the extraordinary Wynton Kelly, jazz pianist for Miles Davis
                    during the late fifties and early sixties!). He displayed an early affinity
                    for all types of music. By the age of thirteen he was already proficient on the
                    clarinet, piano, and bass guitar and had begun composing music. The bass guitar,
                    however, was his love and by the age of fifteen, he was working regularly in
                    New York City with various bands.
