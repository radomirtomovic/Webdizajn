            <h3>What is Jazz?</h3>
            <p>
                Jazz is a kind of music in which improvisation is typically an important part.
                In most jazz performances, players play solos which they make up on the spot,
                which requires considerable skill. There is tremendous variety in jazz, but
                most jazz is very rhythmic, has a forward momentum called "swing," and
                uses "bent" or "blue" notes. You can often hear "call--and--response" patterns
                in jazz, in which one instrument, voice, or part of the band answers another.
                (You can hear Ella Fitzgerald and Roy Eldridge do "call and response" in Ella's Singing Class.)
                Jazz can express many different emotions, from pain to sheer joy.
                In jazz, you may hear the sounds of freedom-for the music has been a powerful voice
                for people suffering unfair treatment because of the color of the skin,
                or because they lived in a country run by a cruel dictator.
