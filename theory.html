            <h3>Chords</h3>
            <p>
                Harmony of jazz is based on harmony of classical music.
                The main difference classical music theory and jazz theory
                is while classical music uses mostly uses triples, jazz
                almost exclusively uses sevenths.
                There are 11 types of seventh chords:
                Major 7 (maj7), dominant 7 (7), Minor-major (maj m7),
                minor 7 (m7), half-diminished 7 (&oslash;7), diminished
                (dim7), augmented (aug7), sustainable chords (sus2 and sus4)
                and major and minor sixth (6 and m6)
            </p>

                    <strong>Major 7</strong>
                    is chord made up of root, major third, perfect fifth and major seventh.
                    His functions are usualy as tonic or chord on subdominant degree of major scale,
                    or chord on third degree of minor scale.

                    <strong>Dominant 7</strong>
                    is chord made up of root, major third, perfect fifth and minor seventh.
                    His most recognisible function is as dominant chord of major and
                    harmonic and melodic minor scales. Every dominant 7 chord has his
                    tritonus substitution. Tritonus is interval of 3 whole steps
                    (a.k.a. augmented forth). If we alter a dominant chord one tritonus
                    up (or down, you will get the same tone in both directions), we will see
                    that two out of four tones will stay the same, and those two would be third and
                    seventh, while root and fifth are going to change. Those two tones, third and
                    seventh, are actualy the most important ones because they determan
                    what type of chord you are using and they will just switch the rolles 
                    (thir of first chor will become seventh of secont chord and seventh of
                    first chord will become third of second chord)

                    <strong>Minor-major 7</strong>
                    is made up of root, minor third, perfect fifth, and major seventh.
                    He could be found as tonic in (harmonic and melodic) minor scales.

                    <strong>Minor 7</strong>
                    chord is made up of root, minor third, perfect fifth and minor seventh.
                    In major scales we can find him on second, third and sixth degree while in (natural) minor
                    scales he is on tonic, subdominant and dominant degree. His role is as subdominant substitution.
